labrad-manager
==============

Python implementation of labrad manager.  This requires an up-to-date
version of pylabrad from martinisgroup/pylabrad on github.  This
should still be considered experimental, but is intended to serve as a
testing area for new labrad features such as new types, more efficient
data protocol, and so forth.

The GUI also requires the qt4reactor, but the console version will run
fine without it.
